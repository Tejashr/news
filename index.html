                <p class="data">Why, the PM has not found anyone more capable than an IAS officer to head the committee for the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya. The chairman of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is also a Babu, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is headed by a Babu as is the chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). <br> Even the Chairman of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) is an IAS officer. Why couldn’t the Prime Minister find an expert to head these bodies is the question!</p>
